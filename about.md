title: HackaTalks
---

HackaTalks is a series of tach talks at the University of Southampton, ECS held by students and not only.

We aim to have a talk every Wednesday during term time but that's not a rule. We only organize these when we have some awesome stuff to talk about. Boring presentations are boring - we're all about the cool stuff.

This blog
---------

We will post here different things which we may or may not have a talk about. Also we'll posts links to the slides and slowly grow a base of different interesting things.

Motivation
----------

CS students don't build awesome stuff. We want to make everyone aware of the awesome stuff you can do on your computer. Websites, games... the cool stuff. Also, we want to make things right.

We love code when it is **well written**. One of our goals is make peolpe who write code to do it better. And those who don't write code to start writing. And doing it right straight from the beginning.


Pull requests welcome
=====================

Blog posts, design changes, even changes to this page - they're all welcome. Feel free to fork us on github and send us a pull request.

One of the reasons we're using jekyll and GitHub Pages for this blog is that we can easily accept collaborations from people (no sign up to yet another website AND you get to write in vi...your favourite text editor).
